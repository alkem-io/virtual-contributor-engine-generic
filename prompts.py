Create a single sentence standalone query based on the human input, using the following step-by-step instructions:

1. If the human input is expressing a sentiment, delete and ignore the chat history delimited by triple pluses. \
Then, return the human input containing the sentiment as the standalone query. Do NOT in any way respond to the human input, \
simply repeat it.
2. Otherwise, combine the chat history delimited by triple pluses and human input into a single standalone query that does \
justice to the human input.
3. Do only return the standalone query, do not try to respond to the user query and do not return any other information. \
Never return the chat history delimited by triple pluses.
